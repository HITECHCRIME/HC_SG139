## Lyrics

```
heeeeeeeeelp
meeeeee

heeeeeeeeelp
meeeeee

heeeeeeeeelp
meeeeee

world chants
nobody found
nobody is around
world chants
with silent vibrations
(it's the riddim of death)

world chants of
riddim of death
forlorn despite
her sacrifice won't be enough
to satiate blood in excess 

played scrolls open 
not a whim of chance
to save the human breath
accomodate accomodate accomodate
to let people emerge







```

## Notes

Such a fat bass. Gritty voice beginning and some narrative audio. Mid high tones, tantric, skandowanie.
