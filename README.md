scrolls played open 
not a whim of chance
to save the human breath
accomodate accomodate accomodate
to let people emerge

world chants of death
world chants of death

hide angst
mantra of lies
you let it fly
can't bear the weight
then wait till you drown

## Notes

Such a fat bass. Gritty voice beginning and some narrative audio. Mid high tones, tantric, skandowanie.
